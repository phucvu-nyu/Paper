# This is an ongoing research project that I am working with Dr.Betensky. 
## The situation: 
- Clinical trials are expensive, there are many outcomes studied.
- Besides the important ones or "primary outcomes", there are secondary and exploratory outcomes that can be used to generate new hypotheses
- The New England Journal of Medicine requires investigators to prespecify a multiplicity adjustment method for secondary and exploratory outcomes if they want to report the p-values
## What we argue:
- The purpose of secondary outcomes is just to generate new hypotheses 
- A post-hoc approach for multiplicity adjustment method may be beneficial and increase the power significantly
## What's here?
- The code in R for my simulation to calculate the FWER and FDR of the post hoc approach
- The code in Python for data visualization
